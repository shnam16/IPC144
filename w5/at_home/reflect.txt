1. Using array of structs have some advantages to show simple and easily. However, if we need to store lots of data, using parallel arrays is a convenient way to store information.

2. I can use more space and it is easy to fix and overwrite. The code in a header file is duplicated inside each C file in which it is included, which allows me to write code, like a struck, in one spot and edit it in that one spot alone.
